# Struct Embedding in Go

This example demonstrates struct embedding in Go. Struct embedding allows one struct to inherit the fields and methods of another struct.

Holy crap. I asked Copilot to create a markdown explanation of this file. 

## Code

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// base is a simple struct with a single field num.
type base struct {
	num int
}

// describe returns a string representation of the base struct.
func (b base) describe() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("base with num=%v", b.num)
}

// container embeds the base struct, meaning it inherits the fields and methods of base.
// It also has an additional field str.
type container struct {
	base
	str string
}

// main is the entry point of the program. It demonstrates the use of struct embedding
// by creating an instance of container and accessing the fields and methods of the embedded base struct.
func main() {
	// Create an instance of container, initializing the embedded base struct and the str field.
	co := container{
		base: base{
			num: 1,
		},
		str: "some name",
	}

	// Access the num field directly from the container instance.
	fmt.Printf("co={num: %v, str: %v}\n", co.num, co.str)

	// Access the num field explicitly through the embedded base struct.
	fmt.Println("also num:", co.base.num)

	// Call the describe method from the embedded base struct.
	fmt.Println("describe:", co.describe())

	// Define an interface that includes the describe method.
	type describer interface {
		describe() string
	}

	// Assign the container instance to a variable of type describer.
	var d describer = co
	// Call the describe method through the interface.
	fmt.Println("describer:", d.describe())
}
```

## Explanation

### base Struct

The `base` struct is a simple struct with a single field `num`. It also has a method `describe` that returns a string representation of the struct.

### container Struct

The `container` struct embeds the `base` struct. This means that `container` inherits the fields and methods of `base`. In addition to the fields and methods of `base`, `container` has an additional field `str`.

### main Function

The `main` function demonstrates the use of struct embedding by creating an instance of `container` and accessing the fields and methods of the embedded `base` struct.

- An instance of `container` is created, initializing the embedded `base` struct and the `str` field.
- The `num` field is accessed directly from the `container` instance.
- The `num` field is also accessed explicitly through the embedded `base` struct.
- The `describe` method from the embedded `base` struct is called.
- An interface `describer` is defined that includes the `describe` method.
- The `container` instance is assigned to a variable of type `describer`, and the `describe` method is called through the interface.
